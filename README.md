# Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer_Submission
My Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition Submission

Posting my code that I used for my Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition submission.

I used this as an opportunity to learn TensorFlow and CNNs.  In preparation I audited Andrew Ng's 'Convolutional Neural Network' course
and also took Jose Portilla's Udemy course 'Complete Guide to TensorFlow for Deep Learning with Python'.  Some of my code is basically
Jose Portilla's CIFAR-10 code but revised to fit my needs and with added comments to explain what is going on and also to show that I 
understand the code. I only choose to copy & edit vs. writting from scratch for convenience and not lack of ability.  I also liked the 
way he chooses to write some of his code and found it fun to tinker with and play around with.  I also tried to not give too many 
comments since I did some copy & edit of code from a course, I didn't want to give any of his instructions away for free.  I 
highly recommend anyone interested in learning TensorFlow to take his course!

I also show how to save a TF model and then make predictions on a hold-out set using that model.

This was a fun little project to get me playing with CNNs and image recognition.  Hope people find this helpful for those 
struggling to make predictions from a trained TF model!
